## [Tips](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Real-Python/tree/master/Tips)

This folder contains some tips to write in a pythonic way ).
1. Comparsion between mutable and imutable types in python. [Here](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Real-Python/blob/master/Tips/1.Immutable.mutable.ipynb)
2. `range()` vs `enumerate()`. [Here](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Real-Python/blob/master/Tips/2.%20range_enumerate.ipynb)
3. List Comprehensions and Built-In Functions on Lists. [Here](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Real-Python/blob/master/Tips/3.%20List%20Comprehensions.ipynb)
4. Using fstring for printing. [Here](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Real-Python/blob/master/Tips/4.%20fstring.ipynb)
5. Using `sort()` and `sorted()` to sort lists and dictionaries. [Here](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Real-Python/blob/master/Tips/5.%20Sorting.ipynb)
